## Install dependencies

```
cd path-to-your-project
npm install
```

### Additional install

```
npm i -g ntl
```

- By running **ntl** you can choose which script to run. For example **start**, **build**, **build:prod** and **watch** will be some of the choices. All of these scripts are in the `package.json` file in the scripts object.
- Command to start **ntl** and choose an option
```
ntl
```

### Without ntl

If you don't want to use ntl you can use the `npm run` command with the chosen script, examples:
- For development bundle
```
npm run build
```
- For production ready bundle
```
npm run build:prod
```
- For development server
```
npm run start
```
- For Webpack watch
```
npm run watch
```
